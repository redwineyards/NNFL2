# NNFL2

From simple and intuitive learning methods like hebbian learning to advanced machine learning concepts like Convoutional Neural networks were covered in this assignment.

What I learnt from this assignment were:

Implementation of non linear perceptron with hebbian learning.

Kernel perceptron

Deep feed forward neural network/ multi layer perceptron

Radial basis function Neaural network
Autencoder
Extreme learning machine
Support Vector Machine
Convolutionl Neural Network
The key advantage of solving this assignment was the satisfaction of conquering the challenging task of not only understanding the above concepts but also implementing them in Python.
